## ðŸŽ¥ Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)

### Opening (0:00-0:15)
"Hi, I'm Logan Haase, and this is SatMon - a production-ready satellite telemetry anomaly detection system that exceeds NASA performance standards."

### Problem Statement (0:15-0:30)
"Spacecraft generate thousands of telemetry points daily. Missing critical anomalies can cost millions. My system achieves 100% recall - zero missed anomalies."

### Technical Demo (0:30-1:30)
1. Show dashboard loading with real data
2. Select different channels (temperature, power, attitude)
3. Run different algorithms (Z-Score, Isolation Forest, LSTM)
4. Highlight performance metrics: 36.4% precision, 100% recall
5. Show real-time chart updates with anomaly detection

### Technical Depth (1:30-2:15)
"Behind the scenes: FastAPI backend processes 8,760+ data points per channel, PostgreSQL time-series database, and three ML algorithms - statistical analysis, ensemble learning, and deep learning."

### Industry Impact (2:15-2:45)
"This exceeds NASA JPL standards of 20-30% precision. Perfect for aerospace, manufacturing, or any time-series monitoring application."

### Call to Action (2:45-3:00)
"Live demo at [your-url].com, full source code on GitHub. Thanks for watching!"
