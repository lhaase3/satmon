### Algorithm Specifics

#### Z-Score Implementation
```python
# Rolling window statistical analysis
window_size = 50
z_threshold = 3.0
rolling_mean = data.rolling(window_size).mean()
rolling_std = data.rolling(window_size).std()
z_scores = (data - rolling_mean) / rolling_std
anomalies = abs(z_scores) > z_threshold
```

#### LSTM Autoencoder Architecture
```python
# Encoder-Decoder with dropout regularization
Encoder: LSTM(128) -> LSTM(64) -> LSTM(32)
Decoder: RepeatVector -> LSTM(32) -> LSTM(64) -> LSTM(128)
Loss: Mean Squared Error
Threshold: 95th percentile of reconstruction error
```

#### Isolation Forest Configuration
```python
# Ensemble isolation approach
n_estimators = 100
contamination = 0.05  # Expected anomaly rate
max_features = 1.0
random_state = 42
```
